* Make a new directory called ~/bin

  ``` mkdir ~/bin ```

* Make a symlink for tfenv/bin/* scripts into the path ~/bin 

  ``` ln -s ~/.tfenv/bin/* ~/bin ```

* With the Terraform Version Manager installed, we can now install Terraform. 

  ``` tfenv install ```

* This will install the latest version of Terraform for you. Take note of the installed version of terrform. In this case, the default version is 1.5.3. 
* To make this version the default version, use the following commmand
  
  ``` tfenv use 1.5.3 ```
  
* Verify you are using the proper version of terraform 

  ``` terraform -v ```
