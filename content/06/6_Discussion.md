## ***Discussion Points During a Demo - Chapter 6***

Key reasons for using a Next Generation Firewall in the cloud:

* FortiGate CNF delivers frictionless security at any scale for AWS environments. Fortinet manages the service delivery infrastructure, simplifying network security operations and lowering costs.
* FortiGate CNF combines next-generation firewall (NGFW) capabilities like intrusion prevention system (IPS), web filtering, domain name system (DNS) security, and moreâ€”with distinct cloud advantages.
* Zero Operations Overhead: Focus only on security-policy management and offload service-infrastructure maintenance to Fortinet
* Elastic Licensing: Pay only for what you use, when you use it
* Leverage Existing Infrastructure: Use existing Fortinet Fabric Ready Solutions like FortiManager, FortiAnalyzer for single pane of glass management and FortiGuard for threat intelligence. 
* Use FortiGate CNF for Inbound, Outbound, and East-West Traffic Inspection and Protection
* Let Fortinet manage the complexities of high-resiliency and scalability of the service delivery infrastructure
