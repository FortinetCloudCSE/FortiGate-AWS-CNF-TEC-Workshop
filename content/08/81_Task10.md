* Clone a repository that uses terraform to create a distributed ingress workload vpc

  ``` git clone https://github.com/FortinetCloudCSE/FortiGate-AWS-CNF-TEC-Workshop.git ```

* Change directory into the newly created repository for distributed_ingress_nlb

  ``` cd ~/FortiGate-AWS-CNF-TEC-Workshop/terraform/centralized_ingress_egress_east_west/ ```
  
* Copy the terraform.tfvars.example to terraform.tfvars

  ``` cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars ```

**Note:** AWS Keypairs are only valid within a specific region. To find the keypairs you have in the region you are executing the lab in, check the list of keypairs here: AWS Console->EC2->Network & Security->keypairs. 
This workshop is pre-configured in the terraform.tfvars to run in the us-west-2 (Oregon) region.

**Note:** You may change the default region in the terraform.tfvars file to another FortiGate CNF supported region if you don't have a valid keypair in that region and you don't want to create one for this workshop.

* Use the "terraform init" command to initialize the template and download the providers

  ``` terraform init ```

* Use "terraform apply --auto-approve" command to build the vpc. This command takes about 5 minutes to complete.

``` terraform apply --auto-approve ```

* When the command completes, verify "Apply Complete" and valid output statements.
  * Copy the "Outputs" section to a scratchpad. We will use this info throughout this workshop.
