* In the next couple of  tasks, we will initialize FortiManager and FortiAnalyzer. Let's start with the FortiAnalzyer. Find the FortiAnalyzer IP address and instance ID from the output of the Terraform template you saved to your scratchpad. Be sure to accept the self-signed certificate presented by FortiAnalyzer.

* This will cause the FortiAnalyzer to reboot and apply the license. This will take a minute.

**Note:** If the FortiAnalyzer reboots to screen asking the user to attach an entitlement file, the FortiAnalyzer is unable to contact FortiCloud to verify the trial license. If this happens, rebooting the FortiAnalyzer from the AWS EC2 screen should resolve the problem.
