# Secure AWS workloads with FortiGate Cloud Native Firewall (CNF)

## Welcome!

AWS Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is elastic, complex, and quite different than traditional on-premise networking. In this workshop you will learn how to use FortiGate Cloud Native Firewall as a Service (FortiGate CNF) to protect your AWS workloads deployed in common architecture patterns.

This workshop is intended to help accomplish the following:

  * Learn common AWS networking concepts such as routing traffic in and out of VPCs for various traffic flows
  * Use AWS Cloudshell and Terraform to deploy a demo environment
  * Interact with FortiGate CNF Portal to deploy CNF instances, build security policy sets, and deploy them
  * Test traffic flows in an example environment and use FortiGate CNF to control traffic flows
  * Configure FortiManager to manage FortiGate CNF instances
  * Configure FortiAnalyzer to collect and analyze logs from FortiGate CNF instances
  * Learn how to use FortiGate CNF to protect AWS workloads in common architecture patterns
  * Configure SDN Connectors to integrate FortiGate CNF with VPC Tagged objects and dynamic policy creation
